# HDR10PQ-neutral-lut
1024x24 , 16-bit , sRGB neutral HDR10pq tuned LUT png

I was unable to locate a LUT online for Cyberpunk 2077 that was specifically made for a 4K OLED HDR10-PQ monitor. This is the result of my toil. This is way out of my 
zone of expertise so there was a lot of AI assist, and, I dont claim its veracity. Simply putting it out there hoping I can spare someone the time and effort.

From what I understand the AI baked the LUT in python as a TIFF, then I converted the TIFF into PNG.

The creation and intention of this is for Reshade 6.5 and later.
